## About the project
This project is a classification system built using CNN that helps determine if a person has RP. The installation process is straightforward, simply run pip install -r requirements.txt to get started.
## Key Features
* Uses FastAPI for the backend
* Utilizes React for a user-friendly frontend
* Includes AuthJWT for secure user authentication
* Implements machine learning algorithms for RP classification
